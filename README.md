A self-balancing robot is a two-wheeled robot that can stand upright without falling.

It can:

✅ Stay balanced automatically

✅ Move forward and backward

✅ Turn left and right

✅ Adjust on small slopes

✅ Be controlled by Bluetooth or remote (if added)

It uses sensors (like a gyroscope) and motors to constantly correct its position.
